# jehtml Just enough HTML

A language inspired by Visual studio code emmet abbreviations.
Tries to use the approach as less as possible, as much as neccessary.
## Includes:
- Tab based
- advanced CSS selector
  - Symbol for ID
  - Symbol for Class
  - Symbol for types even extended to common css types
- variable insertion
- looping
- conditional rendering
- abbreviate common long attributes, tags, etc.
- almost tag independent, custom tags like components easy to integrate
- (add jquery)

## Two ways:
- While Typing as hints/suggestions or
- as a full language which gets compiled after typing.

## Lots of variation should be made possible
- explicit version (curly brackets for tag definition, semicolon as closing (old programming languages style) or every tag on new line (python-like))
- implicit version with
  - swapping symbols
  - adding symbols for own often used attributes or even tags

## Aadvantages & Disadantages

### Advantages:
- fast sketching of code snippets
- structured, forced by tabs
- Customizability

## Disadvantages:
- Readabilty suffers by using few spaces
- Why do you even need this?

Just trying something crazy.
Probably abondon it as soon as my interest goes to something else.
